# Introduction
I am a undergrad student who is about to begin his Master's Thesis. I plan to investigate models that let us predict with some short term accuracy the behavior of time series, **specifically** *"Financial Time Series"*.

I will begin with some recap posts on forecasting techniques that are conventional:
Stuff like AR; MA; ARIMA; GARCH etc...

I hope to quickly move on to the cutting edge deep net models.

For the next one year or so, I will regularly post updates on this website.
